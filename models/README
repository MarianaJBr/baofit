This directory contains tabulated models for BAO fitting.

Fiducial models of the matter power are generated with CAMB then converted to tabulated correlation multipoles with cosmocalc. Note that the cosmocalc cosmology parameters (omega-matter, etc) are not used for running transforms like this, so do not need to be set consistently with the fiducial model.

For the BOSS DR9 Lya mocks, the fiducial model is named "DR9LyaMocks". See the CAMB ini file for details on the assumed cosmology. Model files are created using:

camb DR9LyaMocks.ini
cosmocalc --verbose --load-power DR9LyaMocks_matterpower.dat --rmin 5 --rmax 215 --nr 211 --save-correlation DR9LyaMocks.0.dat
cosmocalc --verbose --load-power DR9LyaMocks_matterpower.dat --rmin 5 --rmax 215 --nr 211 --save-correlation DR9LyaMocks.2.dat --quad
cosmocalc --verbose --load-power DR9LyaMocks_matterpower.dat --rmin 5 --rmax 215 --nr 211 --save-correlation DR9LyaMocks.4.dat --hexa

The "no-wiggles" models can be generated several ways. Models ending with "SB" are sideband models where the region below and above the ell=0 correlation function are fit to a smooth model, which is then interpolated under the peak. The DR9LyaMocks SB model fits xi0(r) from [50,82] and [145,190] Mpc/h to a sum of r^p terms with p = -3,-2,-1,0,1.

For quick visual checks on generated models, use gnuplot, e.g. for r^2 weighting:

plot 'DR9LyaMocks.0.dat' using 1:($1*$1*$2), 'DR9LyaMocksSB.0.dat' using 1:($1*$1*$2) with lines
